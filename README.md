# imp 

imp is a non-working and half completed C interpreter that i wrote to learn more about compiler and interpreter internals (as well as C).

once again, it doesn't work and gives a segmentation fault if it is run because the virtual machine doesn't contain any runnable code.
before adding the lexer it parsed tokens correctly and printed them out and thats about it

it contains a lexer and a bytecode virtual machine, and thats about it.
feel free to look around
